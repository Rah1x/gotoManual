## Features

Currently supporting:

* PHP Manual for functions only (via PHP.net),
* JS Manual (via W3School),
* and the good ol google search

I will update this more later and add more options, but if you have anything in mind just create an issue with the label `enhancement` at the github repo and I will add it as well:

## Requirements

On the first run you would need to add the url base (for example `google.com`) to trusted domains when you see that popup

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `gotomanual.url.Google`: url for Google Search selected text
* `gotomanual.url.PHP`: url for PHP 'function' search via php.net
