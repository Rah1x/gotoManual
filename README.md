Goto various manual with one click (opens in browser).

## Features

Currently supporting:

* PHP Manual for functions only (via PHP.net),
* JS Manual (via W3School),
* and the good ol google search

I will update this more later and add more options.

## Requirements

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `gotomanual.url.Google`: url for Google Search selected text
* `gotomanual.url.PHP`: url for PHP 'function' search via php.net
